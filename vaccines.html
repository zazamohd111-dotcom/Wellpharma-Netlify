        <p>Fall is here, and that means it's time to roll up your sleeve! Getting your vaccines now can keep you healthy through the cold and flu season. At WellPharma Pharmacy in Randallstown, we make it easy to get all your shots in one visit - no appointment needed!</p>

        <p>Let's talk about which vaccines you need this year and answer your common questions.</p>

        <div class="quick-answer-box">
            <h2>Quick Answer: What Vaccines Should I Get?</h2>
            <p><strong>Everyone needs:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Flu shot (every year)</li>
                <li>COVID vaccine (the new 2025 version)</li>
                <li>Tdap booster (every 10 years for tetanus)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Some adults also need:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>RSV vaccine (if you're 50+ with health problems or 75+ years old)</li>
                <li>Pneumonia shots (if you're 50+ or have certain health conditions)</li>
                <li>Shingles vaccine (if you're 50+)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>The Big Three: Flu, COVID, and RSV</h2>

        <h3>Flu Shot - Get It Every Year</h3>
        <p>The flu isn't just a bad cold - it can land you in the hospital. Last season, more than 44,900 people died from flu complications. That's why everyone 6 months and older should get a flu shot every fall.</p>

        <p><strong>What's new this year?</strong> This year's flu shot protects against three types of flu viruses that are expected to spread this winter. The best time to get your flu shot is September or October, but it's never too late if you missed it.</p>

        <p><strong>Special flu shots for older adults:</strong> If you're 65 or older, there are special flu shots just for you that work better because your immune system needs an extra boost.</p>

        <h3>COVID Vaccine - The 2025 Update Is Here</h3>
        <p>Yes, we still need COVID vaccines! The virus keeps changing, so the vaccine gets updated each year, just like the flu shot.</p>

        <p><strong>Who needs it?</strong> Everyone 6 months and older should get the updated 2024-2025 COVID vaccine. Even if you've had COVID or got vaccines before, you still need this year's shot for the best protection.</p>

        <p><strong>Extra doses for some people:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you're 65 or older, you need TWO doses of the 2024-2025 COVID vaccine</li>
            <li>People with weak immune systems might need even more doses - talk to your doctor</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>RSV Vaccine - Not for Everyone, But Important for Some</h3>
        <p>RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) usually causes cold symptoms, but it can be dangerous for older adults and people with health problems.</p>

        <p><strong>Who needs the RSV vaccine?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Everyone 75 years and older</li>
            <li>Adults ages 50-74 who have health conditions like heart disease, lung problems, diabetes, or weak immune systems</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Important:</strong> This is NOT a yearly shot - if you already got it last year, you don't need it again.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>Can I Get Multiple Vaccines at Once?</h3>
            <p><strong>Yes! It's safe and convenient.</strong></p>
            <p>You can get your COVID and flu vaccines at the same visit - it's completely safe. You can even get all three (flu, COVID, and RSV) on the same day if you need them.</p>
            <p>You might feel a bit more tired or achy if you get multiple shots, but that just means your body is building protection. These side effects go away in a day or two.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Vaccines by Age Group</h2>

        <h3>Ages 19-49</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Flu shot (yearly)</li>
            <li>COVID vaccine (2025 version)</li>
            <li>Tdap (if you haven't had one as an adult)</li>
            <li>HPV vaccine (if you didn't get it as a teen, up to age 26)</li>
            <li>MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) if you're not sure you had it</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ages 50-64</h3>
        <p>Everything above, plus:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shingles vaccine (two doses, 2-6 months apart)</li>
            <li>Pneumonia vaccine - the age just dropped from 65 to 50!</li>
            <li>RSV vaccine (only if you have health conditions)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ages 65 and Older</h3>
        <p>Everything above, plus:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Two doses of COVID vaccine instead of one</li>
            <li>Special stronger flu shots</li>
            <li>RSV vaccine (if you're 75+ or have health conditions)</li>
            <li>Make sure you've had both types of pneumonia vaccines</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Special Situations</h2>

        <h3>Pregnant? Vaccines Protect You and Baby</h3>
        <p>Pregnant women should definitely get both flu and COVID vaccines. When you're pregnant, these illnesses can be more dangerous for both you and your baby. The vaccines are safe during pregnancy and give your baby protection too!</p>

        <p>You might also need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tdap vaccine (during each pregnancy, weeks 27-36)</li>
            <li>RSV vaccine (weeks 32-36) to protect your newborn</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Have Health Problems?</h3>
        <p>If you have diabetes, heart disease, lung problems, or a weak immune system, vaccines are extra important for you. These conditions make it harder to fight off infections. Talk to us about which extra vaccines you might need.</p>

        <h3>Work in Healthcare?</h3>
        <p>You need all the regular vaccines plus:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hepatitis B vaccine</li>
            <li>Annual TB testing</li>
            <li>Maybe others depending on your job</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Questions We Hear</h2>

        <p><strong>"Will the vaccines make me sick?"</strong><br>
        No! You can't get the flu from a flu shot or COVID from the COVID vaccine. You might feel tired or achy for a day - that's your body building protection.</p>

        <p><strong>"I never get sick. Do I really need vaccines?"</strong><br>
        Yes! Healthy people can still get very sick from these viruses. Plus, vaccines protect the people around you - like grandchildren, elderly parents, or friends with health problems.</p>

        <p><strong>"Is it too late to get vaccinated?"</strong><br>
        It's never too late! Even getting vaccinated in December or January still helps protect you.</p>

        <p><strong>"How much do vaccines cost?"</strong><br>
        Most insurance plans, including Medicare and Maryland Medicaid, cover vaccines completely. If you don't have insurance, ask us about programs that provide free or low-cost vaccines.</p>
