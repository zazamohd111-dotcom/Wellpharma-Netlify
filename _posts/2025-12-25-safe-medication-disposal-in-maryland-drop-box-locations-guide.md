**Got a medicine cabinet full of expired prescriptions, old antibiotics, or medications you no longer need?** You're not alone. Studies show that up to 50% of people with chronic conditions have unused medications sitting at home—and most don't know the safest way to get rid of them.

Tossing pills in the trash or flushing them down the toilet might seem convenient, but both methods can harm the environment, contaminate our water supply, and even put children and pets at risk. The good news? Baltimore County makes safe medication disposal easier than ever with **free, 24/7 drop boxes** at police precincts throughout the area.

Whether you're clearing out old medications, managing a loved one's estate, or simply doing some spring cleaning, this guide will show you **exactly where and how to safely dispose of medications in Maryland**—with a special focus on options right here in Randallstown and Baltimore County.

## Why Proper Medication Disposal Matters

### Protecting Our Environment

When medications are flushed down toilets or thrown in the trash, they don't just disappear. Pharmaceuticals end up in our water supply through:

* **Sewage systems** that lead to wastewater treatment plants (which can't filter out most pharmaceutical compounds)
* **Landfill leachate** that seeps into groundwater
* **Stormwater runoff** that carries trash into streams and rivers

Research shows that pharmaceutical contamination has been detected in freshwater and marine ecosystems worldwide. These compounds can:

* Disrupt aquatic life and wildlife populations
* Persist in the environment for years
* Enter the food chain through bioaccumulation
* Potentially affect drinking water sources

A recent study from the UK found that reducing unused prescription waste by just £150 million prevented **23,400 tonnes of CO2 emissions**. Minnesota's take-back programs have diverted over **730,000 pounds of medications** from landfills since 2007.

### Preventing Accidental Poisoning

Medications left in home medicine cabinets pose real risks:

* **Children** can mistake colorful pills for candy
* **Pets** can ingest medications left within reach
* **Visitors or house guests** may accidentally take the wrong medication

The FDA maintains a special "flush list" of 13 high-risk medications (mostly opioids like fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine) that are so dangerous they should be flushed immediately if no take-back option is available. These drugs can cause death from a single dose if misused.

### Reducing Drug Diversion and Misuse

While Maryland's current opioid crisis is primarily driven by illicit fentanyl rather than prescription drugs, **securing and disposing of unused medications properly remains critical**. Unused prescription opioids, stimulants, and sedatives in home medicine cabinets can be:

* Stolen or diverted to others
* Misused by family members or visitors
* Accidentally taken by someone for whom they weren't prescribed

Proper disposal removes this risk entirely.

## DEA National Prescription Drug Take-Back Days

Twice a year, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) hosts **National Prescription Drug Take-Back Days**—typically in **April and October**. These events provide additional temporary collection sites throughout Maryland, often at:

* Pharmacies (CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid)
* Community centers
* Libraries
* Hospital parking lots
* Additional police stations

### 2025 Take-Back Results:

The most recent event in **April 2025** collected **620,321 pounds (310 tons)** of unused medications nationally. Maryland participants included dozens of locations across Baltimore County and surrounding areas.

### Upcoming 2026 Events:

* **Spring 2026:** Expected in April (exact date to be announced)
* **Fall 2026:** Expected in October (exact date to be announced)

**How to Find Locations:**

When the next Take-Back Day is announced, you can find participating Maryland locations by:

* Visiting the [DEA Take Back Day website](https://www.dea.gov/takebackday)
* Calling your local pharmacy to ask if they're participating
* Checking Baltimore County Health Department announcements
* Following WellPharma Pharmacy on social media for local event updates

**Pro Tip:** While Take-Back Days offer more locations temporarily, Baltimore County's 24/7 drop boxes mean you don't have to wait for an event. You can safely dispose of medications any time, any day.

## Safe At-Home Disposal (When Drop Boxes Aren't Available)

If you can't make it to a drop box or Take-Back event, the FDA provides guidelines for safe at-home disposal for **most medications** (not the flush list—see below):

### Step-by-Step At-Home Disposal Method:

1. **Mix medications with an unappealing substance:**

   * Used coffee grounds
   * Dirt
   * Cat litter
   * Sawdust

   (Leave pills whole—do not crush tablets or open capsules)
2. **Place the mixture in a sealed container:**

   * Plastic bag (zip-lock or grocery bag tied shut)
   * Empty coffee container with lid
   * Any leak-proof container
3. **Remove personal information:**

   * Scratch out or black out your name, address, and prescription number on empty bottles
   * This protects your privacy
4. **Throw the sealed container in your household trash**
5. **Dispose of or recycle the empty prescription bottles** (with labels removed)

### IMPORTANT: The FDA "Flush List"

A small number of medications (13 active ingredients, mostly opioids) are on the FDA's "flush list" because they pose **extreme danger if accidentally ingested**—even a single dose can be fatal to children, pets, or others.

**If no take-back option is available and you have these medications, the FDA says it's safer to flush them immediately rather than risk someone finding them in the trash:**

* Fentanyl (patches, tablets, films)
* Oxycodone (immediate-release, extended-release)
* Hydrocodone
* Morphine (tablets, solutions)
* Methadone
* Oxymorphone
* Hydromorphone
* Diazepam (rectal gel)
* Methylphenidate (transdermal patch)
* And a few others

**Check your medication label or pharmacy information sheet**—it will indicate if the drug is on the flush list.

**Environmental Note:** The FDA and EPA have determined that the risk to human life from these medications outweighs the minimal environmental impact of flushing them when no take-back is available. Wastewater treatment and environmental dilution make the impact negligible for these specific drugs.

**Always prefer a drop box or take-back program when available**—flushing should be a last resort for these high-risk medications only.

## What You Can and Can't Dispose in Drop Boxes

### ACCEPTABLE for Drop Boxes:

* **Prescription medications** (pills, capsules, liquids in containers)
* **Over-the-counter medications** (pain relievers, cold medicines, vitamins, supplements)
* **Pet medications**
* **Expired medications** of any kind
* **Medications in original containers OR in zip-lock bags**
* **Liquids in sealed, leak-proof containers**

### NOT ACCEPTABLE for Drop Boxes:

**Medical Waste and Sharps:**

* Needles
* Syringes
* Lancets (diabetic testing needles)
* Razor blades
* Any sharp objects

**Other Items:**

* Thermometers (mercury)
* Aerosol cans
* Hydrogen peroxide
* Rubbing alcohol
* Personal care products (lotions, shampoos)

### Special Disposal for Needles and Sharps:

If you use insulin, injectable medications, or have diabetic testing supplies, **do NOT put needles in drop boxes**. Instead:

1. **Use a puncture-resistant container:**

   * Heavy-duty plastic detergent bottle with screw-on cap
   * Fabric softener bottle
   * Empty coffee container with lid
   * Purpose-made sharps container (available at WellPharma and other pharmacies)
2. **Fill the container no more than 2/3 full**
3. **Seal the lid securely** (tape it shut for extra security)
4. **Label the container "SHARPS—DO NOT RECYCLE"**
5. **Place in your regular household trash** (not recycling)

Some pharmacies, including **WellPharma Pharmacy**, can provide guidance on sharps disposal and may accept filled sharps containers—call us at **(410) 698-9068** to ask about our sharps disposal options.

## Pharmacy Take-Back Programs in Maryland

While Baltimore County's police precinct drop boxes are the most reliable year-round option, some pharmacies offer medication disposal programs:

### National Chain Pharmacies:

**CVS, Walgreens, and Rite Aid** participate in medication take-back programs at select Maryland locations through:

* **In-store kiosks or drop boxes** (availability varies by location)
* **Mail-back envelopes** (some locations offer pre-paid disposal envelopes)
* **Participation in DEA Take-Back Days** (check with your local pharmacy)

**How to Find Out if Your Pharmacy Has a Kiosk:**

* Call ahead to ask if they have a permanent medication drop box
* Check the pharmacy's website for take-back program information
* Visit the store and ask the pharmacist

**Note:** Not all pharmacy locations have drop boxes. Chain pharmacies in Maryland tend to participate more during official DEA Take-Back events than offer year-round drop boxes.

### Maryland Prescription Drug Repository Program:

Maryland has a unique program that allows donation of **unopened, unexpired medications and medical supplies** to individuals in need. If you have medications that are:

* Still sealed in their original packaging
* Not expired
* Properly stored
* In good condition

You may be able to donate them instead of disposing of them. Contact participating pharmacies through the [Maryland Department of Health Pharmacy Board](http://dhmh.maryland.gov/pharmacy/Pages/drug-repository.aspx) to see if your medications are eligible for donation.

**This program helps underserved Maryland residents access medications they otherwise couldn't afford**—turning unused medications into life-changing resources for others.
