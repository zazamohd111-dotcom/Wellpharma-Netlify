*A Maryland Woman's Guide to Managing Polycystic Ovary Syndrome*

If you've been diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome—or PCOS—you're joining millions of women navigating this complex hormonal condition. PCOS affects up to 1 in 10 women of reproductive age, and in 2024 alone, 1.55 million new cases were diagnosed worldwide.

Maybe you're dealing with irregular periods that appear every few months (or not at all). Perhaps it's the frustrating acne that won't respond to typical skincare routines, or excess hair growth in unwanted places. You might be worried about fertility, concerned about diabetes risk, or simply exhausted from trying to understand what's happening in your body.

Here's something you should know: **If your doctor has recommended birth control as part of your PCOS treatment plan, you have more options than ever for accessing it conveniently in Maryland.**

At WellPharma Pharmacy in Randallstown, we understand PCOS and the important role birth control plays in managing symptoms. While diagnosing and treating PCOS requires a physician, Maryland pharmacists like us can help make accessing your birth control easier—and we're here to support you every step of the way.

Let's talk about PCOS, why birth control is often prescribed for it, and how we can help you manage this condition.

## What Is PCOS? Understanding the Condition

**Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)** is a hormonal disorder that affects how your ovaries function. Despite the name, you don't necessarily have "cysts" on your ovaries—the term refers to multiple small follicles that can appear on ultrasound.

**Important note:** PCOS is a medical condition that requires diagnosis and management by a physician (typically your primary care doctor or gynecologist). Pharmacists cannot diagnose PCOS, but we can support your treatment plan once established by your doctor.

### The Three Core Features of PCOS

According to the Rotterdam Criteria (updated in 2023), PCOS is diagnosed when you have at least **two of these three features:**

**1. Irregular or absent ovulation**

* Menstrual cycles longer than 35 days
* Fewer than 8 periods per year
* No periods for 3+ months (amenorrhea)
* Unpredictable, irregular cycles

**2. Signs of excess androgens (male hormones)**

* **Clinical signs:** Excess facial or body hair (hirsutism), severe acne, male-pattern scalp hair thinning
* **Biochemical signs:** Elevated testosterone levels on blood tests

**3. Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound**

* Multiple small follicles ("cysts") visible on ovarian ultrasound
* Enlarged ovaries

### What Causes PCOS?

The exact cause isn't fully understood, but PCOS involves several interconnected factors:

**Insulin resistance** - Your body doesn't respond properly to insulin (the hormone that regulates blood sugar). Higher insulin levels trigger your ovaries to produce more androgens (male hormones like testosterone), disrupting ovulation.

**Hormonal imbalance** - Women with PCOS often have:

* Higher levels of luteinizing hormone (LH)
* Lower levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
* Elevated androgens (testosterone)
* These imbalances prevent normal ovulation

**Inflammation** - Many women with PCOS have low-grade chronic inflammation throughout the body, which may contribute to insulin resistance and androgen production.

**Genetics** - PCOS tends to run in families, suggesting inherited factors play a role. If your mother or sister has PCOS, your risk is higher.

### Common PCOS Symptoms

**Menstrual irregularities:**

* Infrequent, irregular, or absent periods
* Heavy bleeding when periods do occur
* Unpredictable cycles making planning difficult

**Androgen-related symptoms:**

* Excess facial and body hair (chin, upper lip, chest, back, abdomen)
* Severe or persistent acne (often doesn't respond to typical treatments)
* Thinning hair on scalp (male-pattern hair loss)
* Oily skin

**Metabolic symptoms:**

* Weight gain, especially around the abdomen
* Difficulty losing weight despite diet and exercise
* Dark, velvety skin patches (acanthosis nigricans) on neck, armpits, or groin
* Skin tags in armpits or neck area

**Reproductive concerns:**

* Difficulty getting pregnant (affects approximately 50% of women with PCOS)
* Increased miscarriage risk (30-50% report pregnancy loss history)
* ~40% lower live birth rate compared to women without PCOS

**Emotional and mental health:**

* Anxiety and depression (very common with PCOS)
* Body image concerns related to weight, hair, or skin
* Stress related to unpredictable symptoms
* Frustration with fertility challenges

### Long-Term Health Risks

If left unmanaged, PCOS increases your risk for:

* **Type 2 diabetes** - Due to insulin resistance; many women with PCOS develop diabetes
* **Cardiovascular disease** - Higher risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease
* **Endometrial cancer** - Irregular periods cause the uterine lining to build up without regular shedding
* **Sleep apnea** - Particularly if you're overweight
* **Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease** - Related to insulin resistance
* **Pregnancy complications** - Including gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, preterm birth

**The good news?** With proper medical management—often including birth control—many of these risks can be significantly reduced.

## Why Doctors Prescribe Birth Control for PCOS

If you're not trying to get pregnant, **your doctor may prescribe hormonal birth control as a first-line treatment for managing PCOS symptoms.** Here's why it's so commonly recommended:

### 1. Regulates Your Menstrual Cycle

Birth control provides the hormones your body isn't producing regularly on its own:

* **Induces regular monthly periods** - You'll have a predictable "withdrawal bleed" every month (or every 3 months with extended-cycle pills)
* **Prevents endometrial buildup** - Regular shedding of the uterine lining prevents excessive thickening
* **Significantly reduces endometrial cancer risk** - One of the most important protective effects

**Why this matters:** When you don't ovulate regularly, your uterine lining continues to grow and thicken without shedding. Over months and years, this significantly increases your risk of endometrial (uterine) cancer. Birth control prevents this dangerous buildup by causing regular shedding.

### 2. Lowers Androgen Levels

Combination birth control pills (containing both estrogen and progestin):

* **Increase sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)** - This protein binds to testosterone in your blood, making less "free" testosterone available to cause symptoms
* **Suppress LH production** - Lower luteinizing hormone means your ovaries produce less testosterone
* **Provide steady hormone levels** - Preventing the hormonal fluctuations that worsen PCOS symptoms

**Results you may notice over time:**

* Reduced facial and body hair growth (typically takes 3-6 months to see improvement)
* Clearer skin and less acne
* Less oily skin and hair
* Improved scalp hair thickness (for some women)

### 3. Improves Quality of Life

Beyond the physical symptoms, birth control for PCOS can:

* **Reduce anxiety** about when your period will arrive
* **Improve body confidence** as skin and hair symptoms gradually improve
* **Simplify planning** - You'll know when to expect your period
* **Provide contraception** - If you're sexually active and not planning pregnancy

### 4. Protects Long-Term Health

By regulating your cycle and lowering androgen levels, birth control helps:

* Prevent endometrial cancer development
* May improve insulin sensitivity in some women
* Supports overall hormonal balance
* Reduces long-term cardiovascular risks associated with PCOS

**Important to understand:** Birth control manages PCOS symptoms but doesn't "cure" the underlying condition. The insulin resistance and hormonal imbalances that cause PCOS are still present. That's why comprehensive PCOS management includes lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, weight management) alongside birth control.

## Best Birth Control Options for PCOS

Not all birth control pills are created equal when it comes to PCOS. Your doctor will consider several factors when recommending the best option for you.

### Combination Pills (Estrogen + Progestin)

**Most effective for PCOS symptom management**

Combination pills are typically the first choice for PCOS because they:

* Regulate menstrual cycles most effectively
* Lower androgens better than progestin-only options
* Provide the most protection against endometrial cancer

**Particularly effective options for PCOS:**

**Drospirenone-containing pills** (e.g., Yaz, Beyaz, Yasmin, generics)

* Drospirenone is a progestin with very low androgenic activity
* Especially good for acne and excess hair growth
* May help with bloating and water retention
* FDA-approved specifically for treating acne

**Other low-androgenic progestin combinations:**

* Desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol (e.g., Desogen, Apri)
* Norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol (e.g., Ortho Tri-Cyclen - FDA-approved for acne)
* Drospirenone/estetrol (Nextstellis - newer option with fewer estrogen-related side effects)

**Monophasic vs. multiphasic:**

* **Monophasic pills** (same hormone dose every day) are often preferred for PCOS for consistent hormone levels
* **Multiphasic pills** (varying doses throughout the month) may work for some women

**Standard vs. extended-cycle:**

* **Standard 28-day packs** - Period every month
* **Extended-cycle** (e.g., Seasonale, Seasonique) - Period every 3 months
* **Continuous** (e.g., Amethyst) - May eliminate periods entirely
* All options protect the endometrial lining; choice depends on your preference

### Progestin-Only Options

These may be recommended if you can't take estrogen due to:

* History of blood clots
* Certain types of migraines
* Breastfeeding
* Smoking over age 35
* Other estrogen contraindications

**Progestin-only pills (mini-pills):**

* Norethindrone (e.g., Heather, Camila)
* Drospirenone (Slynd)
* Less effective at lowering androgens than combination pills
* May not regulate periods as predictably
* Require very consistent daily timing

**Hormonal IUD (intrauterine device):**

* Levonorgestrel-releasing (e.g., Mirena, Kyleena, Skyla, Liletta)
* Thins uterine lining (protects against endometrial cancer)
* May stop periods over time
* Lasts 3-7 years depending on brand
* Doesn't lower systemic androgens as effectively (may not help acne/hair)

### Other Hormonal Options

**Birth control patch** (Xulane)

* Same hormones as combination pills, delivered through skin
* Weekly application
* Convenient for those who have trouble remembering daily pills

**Vaginal ring** (NuvaRing, Annovera)

* Combination hormones delivered vaginally
* Monthly (NuvaRing) or yearly (Annovera) insertion
* Lower hormone doses than pills (for some women)

**Birth control shot** (Depo-Provera)

* Progestin-only injection every 3 months
* May cause weight gain (concern for PCOS patients)
* Can delay return of fertility
* Not typically first choice for PCOS

### Factors Your Doctor Considers

When prescribing birth control for PCOS, your doctor evaluates:

✅ **Your specific PCOS symptoms** - Acne? Excess hair? Irregular periods?\
✅ **Other health conditions** - Migraines, blood clot history, high blood pressure\
✅ **Medications you're taking** - Some interact with birth control\
✅ **Your lifestyle** - Can you remember a daily pill?\
✅ **Future fertility plans** - When do you want to try to conceive?\
✅ **Personal preferences** - Monthly periods or not?\
✅ **Side effect concerns** - Previous experiences with hormones

**The bottom line:** The "best" birth control for PCOS is the one that manages your specific symptoms effectively with minimal side effects—and that you'll use consistently.

## Beyond Birth Control: Comprehensive PCOS Management

Birth control is an important tool for managing PCOS, but it works best as part of a comprehensive approach. Here's what else helps:

### Lifestyle Modifications (First-Line Treatment)

**According to WHO guidelines and 2023 international PCOS guidelines**, lifestyle intervention is the foundation of PCOS management for ALL patients:

**Weight management (if overweight):**

* Even 5-10% weight loss can restore ovulation in many women
* Reduces insulin resistance
* Improves hormone balance
* May allow lower birth control doses or even resolution of some symptoms

**Diet modifications:**

* **Low-glycemic index foods** - Whole grains, vegetables, legumes, lean proteins
* **Reduce refined carbohydrates** - Less white bread, sugary foods, processed foods
* **Increase fiber** - Helps regulate blood sugar and insulin
* **Healthy fats** - Olive oil, avocados, nuts, fatty fish
* **Adequate protein** - Supports satiety and muscle maintenance

**Regular physical activity:**

* **150 minutes per week** of moderate exercise (brisk walking, swimming, cycling)
* **Strength training** 2-3 times per week - Builds muscle, improves insulin sensitivity
* **Consistency matters more than intensity** - Find activities you'll actually do

**Why lifestyle matters:** Studies show that structured 6-month lifestyle programs improve fertility outcomes, reduce diabetes risk, and enhance the effectiveness of other PCOS treatments.

### Medications for Insulin Resistance

Your doctor may prescribe:

**Metformin (Glucophage):**

* Improves insulin sensitivity
* May help with weight loss
* Can restore ovulation in some women
* Often used alongside birth control
* Available at WellPharma - we provide thorough counseling on taking metformin to minimize GI side effects

### Supplements That May Help

At WellPharma, we carry **[professional-grade supplements](https://www.wellpharmapharmacy.com/supplements.html)** that research suggests may benefit PCOS:

**Inositol (Myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol):**

* Improves insulin sensitivity
* May help restore ovulation
* Supports egg quality
* Typical dose: 2,000-4,000mg daily

**Vitamin D:**

* Many women with PCOS are deficient
* Supports insulin sensitivity and hormone balance
* Get levels checked by your doctor

**Omega-3 fatty acids:**

* Anti-inflammatory effects
* May improve insulin resistance
* Supports cardiovascular health

**N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC):**

* Antioxidant that may improve insulin sensitivity
* Some research shows benefit for PCOS symptoms

**Chromium:**

* May improve insulin sensitivity
* Research is mixed but some women report benefits

**Important:** Always discuss supplements with your doctor and pharmacist, especially if you're taking other medications. Quality matters—we can guide you toward reputable brands with third-party testing.

### For Women Trying to Conceive

If pregnancy is your goal, birth control isn't appropriate (obviously!). Your doctor may recommend:

**Ovulation induction medications:**

* **Letrozole** (first-line for PCOS fertility)
* **Clomiphene citrate** (Clomid) - alternative option
* These medications help trigger ovulation

**If oral medications don't work:**

* Injectable gonadotropins (FSH injections)
* Intrauterine insemination (IUI)
* In vitro fertilization (IVF) - highly effective for PCOS patients

**Timeline:** Most fertility treatments are tried for 3-6 months before moving to the next option. Approximately 50% of women with PCOS will need some fertility assistance, but most who seek treatment successfully conceive.

### Regular Medical Monitoring

Even if your symptoms are well-controlled, regular follow-up with your doctor is important:

**Recommended screening:**

* **Annual well-woman exam** - Pelvic exam, Pap smear per guidelines
* **Blood pressure monitoring** - PCOS increases cardiovascular risk
* **Cholesterol/lipid panel** - Every 2-5 years or as recommended
* **Diabetes screening** - Fasting glucose or A1C annually or every 2 years
* **Liver function tests** - Especially if overweight or on metformin
* **Mental health screening** - Depression and anxiety are common with PCOS

## Frequently Asked Questions About PCOS and Birth Control

**Q: Will birth control cure my PCOS?**

A: No. Birth control manages PCOS symptoms very effectively, but it doesn't cure the underlying hormonal and metabolic issues that cause PCOS. When you stop birth control, symptoms typically return unless you've made significant lifestyle changes or your PCOS improves with age.

**Q: Can I get pregnant if I have PCOS?**

A: Yes! While PCOS is a leading cause of infertility, approximately 50% of women with PCOS conceive without medical intervention. The other 50% may need fertility treatments (medications to induce ovulation, IUI, or IVF), but most women with PCOS who seek treatment successfully have children.

**Q: Will birth control make me gain weight?**

A: Weight gain is a common concern, but modern low-dose birth control pills typically do not cause significant weight gain. Some women experience temporary water retention in the first few months. If weight gain occurs and persists, talk to your doctor about switching formulations. The insulin resistance from PCOS itself is more likely to cause weight issues than birth control.

**Q: How long do I need to take birth control for PCOS?**

A: Many women with PCOS take birth control for years—often until they want to try to conceive, or until menopause. As long as you're benefiting from it and not experiencing concerning side effects, you can continue taking birth control. Your doctor will reassess your need periodically.

**Q: Can I take birth control and metformin together?**

A: Yes! Many women with PCOS take both. Metformin addresses insulin resistance, while birth control regulates hormones and prevents endometrial cancer. They work through different mechanisms and complement each other well.

**Q: What happens if I stop taking birth control?**

A: Your PCOS symptoms will likely return within a few months. Irregular periods, acne, and excess hair growth may come back. Your endometrial cancer risk increases again if you're not having regular periods. Always discuss stopping birth control with your doctor first.

**Q: Do I need to see a doctor if I'm getting birth control from a pharmacist?**

A: If you have PCOS, yes—you should maintain regular care with a physician who can monitor your overall PCOS management, order necessary lab work, and adjust your treatment plan. Pharmacist-prescribed birth control is a convenience for contraception access, not a replacement for comprehensive medical care of a chronic condition like PCOS.

**Q: Can pharmacists prescribe metformin for my PCOS?**

A: No. In Maryland, pharmacists can prescribe birth control for contraception, but medications like metformin that treat medical conditions (like PCOS-related insulin resistance) require a physician prescription.

**Q: What if I can't afford birth control?**

A: Most insurance plans cover birth control at $0 copay under the Affordable Care Act. If you're uninsured or underinsured, we can help you find:

* Patient assistance programs
* Manufacturer coupons and savings cards
* Lower-cost generic options
* Community health center resources

Call us at **(410) 698-9068** and we'll work with you to find an affordable solution.
